# Algorithms
Classic algorithms implementations.

Currently following algorithms are implemented.

**Data types:**

* Stack (array stack and linked list stack implementations)
* Queue (array implementation)

_TBD: other data types_

**Sorting:**

* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Bubble sort
* Shell sort (using Shell's, Pratt's and Knuth's gap sequences)

_TBD: merge sort and quick sort algorithms._

**Search:**

* Binary search

**Evaluation:**

* Conversion of the mathematical expression from infix to postfix notation (Shunting-yard algorithm by Edsger W. Dijkstra)
* Evaluation of the mathematical expression in postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation algorithm by Charles L. Hamblin)

**Graph:**

* Finding the shortest path in the graph (algorithm by Edsger W. Dijkstra)

_TBD: other algorithms_
